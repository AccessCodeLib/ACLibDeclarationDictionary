# ACLib Declaration Dictionary
This Add-In lists all VBA declarations (variables, function names, constants, etc.) and ensures consistent letter case.

The idea was born from a discussion ([msaccess-vcs-add-in: issue 599](https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-addin/issues/599)) about the behavior of the VBA editor, which adapts each existing declaration to the last written capitalization of the same word. This leads to many unnecessary changes in commits when using version control.
